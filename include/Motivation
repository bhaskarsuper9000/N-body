Motivation:

Interested in simulation, cognition
Background of aerospace
Interested in astronomy
Strong in C++
Interested in utilizing my skills in programming in my academic field of interest

Program: 12 weeks time

Week 0: add support for collision, aggregation
Week 1: work on data dump methods, input format for particle distribution
Week 2: add support for different types of particles and forces like emag, high speed collisions. etc.
Week 3: optimize Bayer-Hut method for torus, most common shapes of planetary dust clouds
Week 4: add Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh Method
Week 5: add ui, improvements in PPPM method
Week 6: add other methods to calculate position, of different orders (Runga-Kutte),(Adams-Bashforth), others
Week 7: run simulations on different methods, with different thresholds, different particle distributions

All the time: update documentation to reflect changes in codes, blog entries to notify the community
              keep contact with the mentor through irc/phone/email at least once a week, more if possible
              proper communication of problems, feedback related to progress, speed, quality of code, documentation, etc.

Later: Complete any incomplete documentation, finish blog entries
